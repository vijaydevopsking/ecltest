# AWS Elastic Beanstalk CloudFormation Template

## Overview
This CloudFormation template sets up an AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment to deploy a web application. It is configured to use an existing VPC and subnets and allows for customization of various parameters including instance types, auto-scaling settings, and the application source code location.

## Prerequisites
- AWS Account and AWS CLI configured with appropriate access.
- An S3 bucket with the application source code.
- Existing VPC and Subnet IDs where the Elastic Beanstalk environment will be deployed.

## Template Parameters
- `ApplicationName`: Name of the Elastic Beanstalk Application.
- `EnvironmentName`: Name of the Elastic Beanstalk Environment.
- `VPCId`: The ID of the existing VPC.
- `SubnetIds`: The IDs of the existing subnets.
- `InstanceType`: EC2 instance type for the Elastic Beanstalk environment.
- `MinSize`: Minimum size of the Auto Scaling group.
- `MaxSize`: Maximum size of the Auto Scaling group.
- `ApplicationSourceBucket`: S3 bucket name where the application code is stored.
- `ApplicationSourceKey`: S3 key (path) to the application code.
- `SolutionStackName`: Solution stack name for the environment.

## Usage
1. **Prepare Your Application**: Make sure your application is packaged and uploaded to an S3 bucket. Note down the bucket name and the key (path) to the application file.

2. **Set Up Parameters**: Fill in the parameters in the template. If you're not sure about the `SolutionStackName`, refer to the [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/concepts.platforms.html) for available Elastic Beanstalk solution stacks.

3. **Launch Stack**:
   - Via AWS Management Console: Navigate to CloudFormation, create a new stack, and upload this template. Fill in the required parameters when prompted.
   - Via AWS CLI: Use the `aws cloudformation create-stack` command with the necessary parameters.

4. **Monitor Deployment**: Once the stack creation is initiated, you can monitor the progress in the AWS CloudFormation console. The deployment can take a few minutes to complete.

5. **Access Your Application**: After successful deployment, you can access your application using the URL provided in the Outputs section of the CloudFormation stack.

## Outputs
- `ApplicationURL`: URL of the Elastic Beanstalk application.
- `EnvironmentId`: ID of the Elastic Beanstalk environment.

## Customization
You can customize this template further as per your requirements. For more complex scenarios, such as adding database configurations or additional AWS services, modify the template accordingly.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure that the IAM role has sufficient permissions.
- Verify that the S3 bucket and application source key are correct and accessible.
- Check the Elastic Beanstalk environment logs for specific application deployment issues.
